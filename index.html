                    <h3>What is a health sharing program?</h3>
                    <p class="regular-text">Faith-based healthshares are offering an alternative health coverage option
                        where 100’s of thousands of like-minded people agree to share the medical expenses for members
                        in their group. There are many options within this category, and some have very little demand on
                        the manner and degree to which their members observe and practice their faith. The monthly
                        contributions, in lieu of the standard monthly premiums that insurance companies charge, are
                        often much lower than most traditional insurance options.</p>

                    <h3>How does my doctor or hospital get paid?</h3>
                    <p>Once your medical provider has properly processed your medical claim to be shared by the
                        membership, the medical need is adjudicated and payment is issued through the member’s escrow
                        account.</p>

                </div>

                <div class="column">
                    <h3>Do I need to be of a certain faith for membership?</h3>
                    <p>The Health Sharing programs we represent welcome members of ALL faiths who can honor a simple
                        Statement of Belief in a higher power and personal responsibility for one’s health.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Are healthshare programs a viable alternative?</h3>
                    <p>It is estimated that more than one million people are already members of Health Sharing
                        Ministries nationwide. This number is growing rapidly due to the rising costs of traditional
                        insurance and coverage shortfalls of other less expensive options.</p>
